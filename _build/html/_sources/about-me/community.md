# Community Initiatives

Throughout my academic career at Ivey and beyond, I've been deeply engaged in a variety of community initiatives, focusing on expanding access to knowledge, fostering leadership, and cultivating spaces for innovation in technology and business. These experiences have taught me to lead and contribute to my communities, both on and off campus.

## Ivey Business Review

As the publisher of the [Ivey Business Review](https://iveybusinessreview.ca), I have had the opportunity to lead an outstanding team of 45 writers and designers to release 12 articles per semester. These articles range from deep dives into global strategies to insights into emerging technologies. Under my leadership, the Ivey Business Review has tripled its readership to 40,000 visits per year. One of our key highlights was a global expansion strategy for Cohere, focusing on making generative AI more accessible in low-resource languages—a piece that has become our most-read article, receiving over 12,000 impressions.

This initiative has empowered students to explore and publish research on topics of significant social and economic impact. Additionally, it has been a vital space for fostering collaboration among students with diverse perspectives and interests, which contributes to the broader academic discourse.

## Ivey Technology Club

In my role as Co-President of the [Ivey Technology Club](https://iveytechclub.ca), I have led a team of 20 executives dedicated to providing educational and recruiting opportunities for over 250 students passionate about the intersection of technology and business. The club has organized a range of events, from coding workshops to talks with technology leaders, helping students navigate the complexities of the modern tech landscape.

Together with my co-president Vivek Jariwala, the Ivey Technology Club has scaled its operations by doubling its executive team size and creating a thriving community that helps technologists navigate the business world. We hope that over the course of our upcoming term, our efforts make a lasting impact both in terms of student skill development and career outcomes.
