# In the Community

Throughout my time at Ivey and beyond, I've been very lucky to work with a number of amazing individuals and clubs in the community. Through various projects, I've sought to expand access to knowledge, grow my leadership skills, and create opportunities for peers in the fields of business and technology.

## Ivey Business Review

As the publisher of the [Ivey Business Review](https://iveybusinessreview.ca) (IBR), I have had the opportunity to lead an outstanding team of 45 writers and designers to release 10 to 12 articles per semester. My favorite aspect of IBR is the wide spread of industries, ideas, and individuals that we get to work with. Having been with the publication as a researcher in the first and second years, author and editor in the third year, and now as an editorial board member in the fourth year, I'm very proud to share that we've grown IBR's yearly web traffic and readership to around 40,000! We also frequently show up in the top Google Search results for the companies and strategies we've written about.

The Ivey Business Review is Canada's oldest and best-known student-run strategy journal, empowering students to publish their research and ideas on creative business strategies.

## Ivey Technology Club

As a co-president of the [Ivey Technology Club (ITC)](https://iveytechclub.ca) alongside Vivek Jariwala, I lead a team of 20 HBA 2/3 (fourth and fifth-year) executives dedicated to providing educational and recruiting opportunities for over 250 students. We target two key demographics:

Yes, this is basically every student at Ivey. ITC isn't just for business dual degrees with computer science or software engineering! With over 500 alumni working in technology around the world, ITC works extensively with industry leaders to bring valuable networking and learning opportunities to students.
```

1. Students looking to work in the technology industry;
2. Those aspiring to better use technology in their role, regardless of industry.

This year, ITC is back and bigger than ever, boasting more members, executives, and events than we have ever had in the past. To take a look at what we've planned, check out our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iveytechclub/) and [website](https://iveytechclub.ca).

## Hack Western

As an events organizer and transport coordinator, I get the rare opportunity to simultaneously exercise my love for [hackathons](./projects.md) and public transport! ðŸ˜ƒ
