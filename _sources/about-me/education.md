## Ivey Business School

I'm wrapping up my undergraduate the Ivey Business School, focusing on business administration while carrying over a foundation of technical knowledge from my previous coursework in computer science. Cumulatively since first year, I have achieved a 3.9/4.0 CGPA, and seek to study strategy, technology, and leadership in businesses.
I have been incredibly fortunate to receive a **National Scholarship** among other awards recognizing my performance in coursework and contributions to technology leadership.

```{note}
The National Scholar designation is a university entrance award emphasizing both academic excellence and demonstrated leadership.

### Research Focus

My academic journey at Ivey also includes a deep dive into enterprise strategy and risk management for **large language models (LLMs)**. Alongside faculty, I spent a summer researching this space, where I contributed to case writing and research dissemination. I hope to see my case about chatbot safety at Air Canada published soon!

I completed this work thanks to the **Undergraduate Summer Research Internship (USRI)** program, which enabled me to developed a product that assists political researchers in understanding organizational and political interests using generative AI models.

```{admonition} Funding Opportunity
The Undergraduate Summer Research Internship (USRI) provided both funding and access to resources that allowed me to explore how LLMs can be responsibly integrated into enterprise operations. I highly recommend Western main campus and Ivey students to apply for such opportunities; applications typically open via email in March.

## Western University - Computer Science

Before transitioning into business, I completed two years in **computer science** at Western University, where I maintained aa 92% GPA in the program. This technical foundation continues to inform my approach to data, AI, and problem-solving today. During my time there, I earned the **Robert and Ruth Lumsden Academic Scholarship** and secured a spot on the Deanâ€™s Honour List for two consecutive years.

```{margin} Fast Fact:
Computer science helped sharpen my technical problem-solving abilities, which later came into play in working with large-scale data and AI projects during research.
