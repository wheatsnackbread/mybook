## Undergrad: HBA at Ivey

I'm finishing up my last year of Honours Business Administration at Ivey Business School, while carrying over my technical knowledge from my first two years in computer science. Since first year, I have maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.9/4.0, and enjoy studying applications of strategy, technology, and leadership in businesses.

I have been incredibly fortunate to have received various awards recognizing my performance in coursework and contributions to technology leadership.

## Research and Business Case Writing

During summer 2024, I was fortunate to be selected as completing Ivey HBA students completing the **Undergraduate Summer Research Internship (USRI)**, which gave me the opportunity to write various business case studies and develop semantic search/retrieval-augmented generation applications for analyzing government relations data.

I'm continuing my work during the year as part of the Ivey Case Writing, the Ivey Field Project – New Venture capstone, and the Digital Strategy and Policy courses. Interested in what I'm writing? Here are some case topics I'm working on right now:

#### Case Topics

```{admonition} Research Opportunity
The Undergraduate Summer Research Internship (USRI) provided both funding and access to experts that allowed me to explore my interests at a much deeper level. I highly recommend that Western main campus and Ivey students apply for this opportunity when it opens via email in March.

## Western University - Computer Science

Before transitioning into business, I completed two years in **computer science** at Western University, where I maintained a 92% GPA in the program. Even though I'm no longer in the program, I continue to build on my technical foundation to this day. During my time there, I maintained a spot on the Dean’s Honour List for both consecutive years.

```{margin} Fast Fact:
Computer science taught me how to build and solve problems from a code-first perspective. It really helped me understand big-picture data and AI concepts that I applied in my internships and academic research.

## Certifications

I currently hold or have previously passed 9 certifications in cloud, data, and AI from Microsoft. I also hold the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) designation from the Project Management Institute.
