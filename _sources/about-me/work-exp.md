# Professional Experience

## Microsoft - Data & AI Technical Specialist Intern (Summer 2024)

At Microsoft, I had the opportunity to dive into some of the most challenging and high-impact projects that fused both technical prowess and business strategy. I led the way in helping major financial, public, and retail sector clients move to Azure OpenAI solutions, guiding their cloud adoption and demonstrating how to leverage generative AI to accelerate business operations. A huge win came when I helped one of the leading financial institutions onboard 16 teams onto Azure by coaching them to success at Canada’s largest banking GenAI hackathon—an effort that contributed to a **significant increase in Azure consumption and new projects** compared to competitors.

```{note}
One of my greatest learnings was that Generative AI opens transformative opportunities in financial services, but to get buy-in, clarity around data governance and risk must be established.
```

I also played a significant role in prototyping “chat with your data” applications, providing clients with a seamless way to integrate Azure OpenAI's retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) services. My work here extended beyond delivering functional demos—it meant becoming a trusted advisor and showing how embedding SQL into their architecture could evolve their data practices.

```

Alongside the client-facing work, I designed a tool that translates SQL stored procedures to Spark SQL for use in Azure Databricks. This wasn’t just about making SQL-to-Spark migration faster but making it **intuitive** for internal architects and customers alike. With Jupyter Notebooks at the core, the tool breaks down complex SQL workflows into easily manageable steps, allowing our clients to see dependencies clearly and accelerate their own cloud journeys.

### Impactful Outcomes

- **Client Hackathons**: Coached client teams through a GenAI hackathon, securing top three placements and driving executive endorsement to choose Azure as their LLM platform.
- **Custom Solutions**: Delivered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications for major financial and retail clients, showcasing the power of integrated cloud-native AI.
- **T-SQL to Spark Converter**: Built and deployed a tool that cuts SQL-to-Spark migration time by **60 to 80 hours** per client project, directly increasing Azure Databricks adoption.

## Environment and Climate Change Canada - Data Scientist Intern (Fall 2023 – Winter 2024)

In a more mission-driven setting, I worked with the Canadian government to improve their national waste characterization reporting. I designed data pipelines to **consolidate 200 sources** into a unified data warehouse using Python and SQL, streamlining analysis that used to take weeks. I also created the department's first chatbot, enabling analysts to search through thousands of PDF documents in seconds, saving them **two hours per week** on average. The success of this tool led to a formal proposal for its replication across other federal departments.

Government solutions can be elegant too: my chatbot design.
```

### Impactful Outcomes

- **Chatbot Development**: Built a search chatbot for business analysts, saving **2 hours/week** per user.
- **Data Unification**: Engineered a solution to combine **200 waste report sources**, streamlining government reporting.

Certainly! Here's a continuation that focuses on the specific Ernst & Young (EY) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) experiences:

## Ernst & Young (EY) - Technology Consultant Intern (Generative AI & Program Management) - Summer 2023

In my second summer at EY, I worked on cutting-edge projects centered around generative AI. Partnering closely with Microsoft, I helped spearhead the development of a **generative AI risk framework**. This framework tackled crucial regulatory and compliance concerns that our banking clients faced when adopting disruptive technologies like OpenAI. By conducting targeted research and prototyping **information retrieval systems**, we showed how generative AI could be used responsibly within highly-regulated environments.

```{note}
Balancing innovation with compliance is critical when introducing AI into financial systems.
```

I also led stand-ups and facilitated design sessions with a 10-person product team. This involved managing the technical aspects of **cybersecurity** and **UI/UX** alongside development, guiding the delivery of a project.

## Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) - Business Analyst Intern (Agile Transformation) - Fall 2022

At TD, I worked as a Business Analyst Intern focused on **Agile transformation**. My responsibilities included providing **bi-weekly debriefs to senior executives**, where I used Power BI to track the implementation of scaled Agile methodologies. I reported on Jira epics, roadmap progress, and blockers, helping the organization prioritize and manage risk effectively during their transformation process.

```{tip}
Clear communication and real-time data are essential when steering large Agile transformations.
```

## Ernst & Young (EY) - Technology Consultant Intern (Data Engineering) - Summer 2022

In my first summer at EY, I concentrated on **data engineering** projects for financial institutions. I developed a high-performance actuarial calculation engine, leveraging Python and Azure to produce IFRS 17 Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) statements at **4 times the speed** of competitors, helping to bring in additional client work. Additionally, I worked with migrating retail customers across banking systems using **Azure Data Factory** and **SQL** as part of EY’s largest banking transformation project.

Through the use of the DeepL API, I reduced the localization costs for a credit union’s user interface significantly, completing the project in just **five days** compared to the typical month-long timeline of hiring professional translators.

## Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) - Project Management Analyst Intern (Spring 2022)

At ESDC, I was part of a project management team within the PMO. My main task was to **automate expense workbooks**, cutting the processing time by **50%** using Python. I also analyzed the department's **SharePoint 2011 authentication flows** to outline the necessary changes for their migration to **M365**.

```{note}
Automation isn’t just about speed, it’s about freeing up valuable time for higher-impact work.
```
